# Towards a Robust On-line Performance Model Identification Change Impact Prediction Dataset

This repository contains the datasets used to train/test our models in the paper titled "Towards a Robust On-line Performance Model Identification Change Impact Prediction Dataset". 

There are three main directories. The first directory contains the O<sub>0</sub> datasets for when the in-production application, Acme-Air, is only running on our environment. The second directory contains the O<sub>t</sub> datasets where the LAS is deployed alongside Acme-Air. The third directory contains the dataset where the co-located IoT application is deployed alongside Acme-Air, and its measured response time is compared with the predicted response time from our LAS-based model.
