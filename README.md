# Towards a Robust On-line Performance Model Identification Change Impact Prediction Dataset

This repository contains the datasets used to train/test our models in the paper titled "Towards a Robust On-line Performance Model Identification Change Impact Prediction Dataset". 

There are three main directories. The first directory contains the O<sup>0</sup> datasets for when the in-production application, Acme-Air, is only running on our environment.
